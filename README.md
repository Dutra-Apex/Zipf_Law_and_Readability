This project's code was build to investigate the possible correlations between Zipf's Law and Readability Scores. 
The code's main goal is to utilize the slope of a Zipfian distribution from a given text to analyze and quantify the text's complexity through the metric of Flesch's Readability Scores. If the algorithm's resulting scores are accurate, it implies that Zipf's Law is directly correlated to text complexity and readability.
